            Crimson Crow Studios aims to create enjoyable, polished, and accessible games that players of all 
            backgrounds can appreciate. We focus on crafting simple yet engaging experiences that highlight 
            creativity, atmosphere, and thoughtful design. At our core, we are committed to continuous 
            improvement—refining our skills, experimenting with new ideas, and steadily growing our abilities 
            as developers. Over time, we hope to become highly proficient in game development and expand the 
            scale, depth, and ambition of our projects. With each game we create, we aim to learn, evolve, and 
            build a portfolio that reflects our passion for making memorable interactive experiences.

            Hello I'm Eric, I’m currently majoring in computer science, and I’ve really been enjoying exploring the creative side of 
            technology through web design and creating video games. I love how it combines logic and artistry — writing code that 
            brings visual ideas to life. Each project I take on helps me improve my skills in design and development, and it’s 
            exciting to see how my work can create meaningful digital experiences for others.
