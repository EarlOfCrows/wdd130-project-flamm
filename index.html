            Hello I'm Eric, I’m currently majoring in computer science, and I’ve really been enjoying exploring the creative side of 
            technology through web design and creating video games. I love how it combines logic and artistry — writing code that 
            brings visual ideas to life. Each project I take on helps me improve my skills in design and development, and it’s 
            exciting to see how my work can create meaningful digital experiences for others.
